download dataset from [Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)

Then run the preprocess_extract.py file to create numpy files for test and train dataset

The jupyter file contains the architecture.

The model has a modified VGG16 architecture.

the current model has 60% validation accuracy.
